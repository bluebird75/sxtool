Future:
- verify file consistency when loading it
- sxfile[] will access data only while sxfile.sxitemsex will access all items
- make sxfile use a proper iterator
- complain if file has no S0 or S9 record
- undo/redo
- search for address or data
- add an icon
- save recent files in a proper format and location
- rewrite the dialog apply offset: add a spacer, the field is too large
- rewrite the dialog for edit data, to avoid the help button and have proper dialog size
- Add function to recalculate checksum on the whole file
- Add function to verify checksum on the file
- Edit Data should also work on first line
- should be able to edit address
- Bug: Menu entry Edit / select all does not work, but CTRL+A works...
- do not use Any
- user proper type annotations for PyQt types
- use enum for DataTable.ISTART
- make the code PEP8 for the pleasure or the eye
